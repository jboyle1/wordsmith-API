## Name of Project: Word Smith (using Javascript API)

This project was a Codecademy exercise that I decided to recreate in my text editor (VS Code). I thought it would be a good idea to show that I understand the concept of using an AJAX **GET** request to retrieve and use an API. 

This particular API allows you to input and submit a word. Then you get back a list of words that rhyme. I basically completed the challenge on the Codecademy website then rewrote the code in my own text editor using version control to document my steps. I found this useful to get a solid understanding of the process.
